          <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Introduction of Social Media Analytics</h2>
          <p class="text-white-50">According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/833743/us-users-ride-sharing-services/">statista</a>,
            Uber’s active users were notably increased in the past few years, the number of users gained from 50
            million in 2016 to 110 million in 2019. In order to keeping those users while exploring new users, it is
            valuable to know what are people talking about this brand. Thanks of social media, it is much easier to get
            more feedback from people than before. Base on introduction of Social Media Analytics and Intelligence,
            this is concerned with developing and evaluating informatics tools and frameworks to collect, monitor,
            analyze, summarize, and visualize social media data, usually driven by specific requirements from a target
            application.

          </p>
          <p class="text-white-50 text-lg-left mb-0">Social media analytics research serves several purposes:
            <ul class="text-white-50 text-lg-left ml-0">
              <li>
                facilitating conversations and interaction between online communities
              </li>
              <li>extracting useful patterns and intelligence to serve entities that include, but are not limited to
                active contributors in ongoing dialogues.

          report of The
          Power of Social Media Analytics</a>, social media analytics involves a three-stage process: capture,
        understand and present. This report would be more focus on the capture and understand stages.

      </p>
      <div class="featured-text text-center text-lg-left">
        <h4>In the capture step
        </h4>
      </div>
      <p class="text-black-50">The social media platform is used Twitter as the resource, because a tweet is a
        message of up to 140 characters. Three types of tweets are found in Twitter: original tweets, replies, and
        retweets. Original tweets appear in the sender's profile page and Home-timeline. Such an original tweet can be
        retweeted by other users. Also, Twitter users can join the conversation by @replying to others and retweeting.
        These tweets are traceable. Twitter offers API to researchers, practitioners, and organizations that are
        interested in collecting and analyzing tweets (<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs">Twitter</a>).

      </p>
      <p class="text-black-50">The capture stage must balance the need for finding information from all quarters
        (inclusivity) with focusing on sources that are most relevant and authoritative (exclusivity)
        to assist in more refined understanding. So, by using ‘Uber’ as a keyword, the report can be effective to
        gather the most relevant information. The amount of data was collected in 486,317 from 26/11/2019 to
        29/11/2019, which included 155,283 of original tweets and 331,034 of retweets. It was clear to show almost 70%
        data were from retweets.
      </p>
      <div class='ml-auto mr-auto col-xl-8 col-lg-7' id="piechart" style="width: 900px; height: 500px;"></div>
      <div class="featured-text text-center text-lg-left">
        <h4>In the understanding step
        </h4>
      </div>
      <p class="text-black-50">This stage provides information about users’ sentiments—how they feel about the
        company and its products— and their behaviors. Many useful metrics and trends about users can be produced in
        this stage, covering their backgrounds, interests, concerns, and networks of relationships.

      </p>

      <p class="text-black-50">At first, by using PrivotTable function of excel, there were 394,047 users in
        original data and the top tweeter and retweeter were drivingjustice which tweeted 3,957 tweets and ShieldVoC
        which retweeted 667 tweets respectively during the period.
      </p>
      <p class="text-black-50">However, the times of tweets and retweets were too high than general, according to
        the article, a human Twitter user might post 10-15 times a day. A bot account will post with high frequency, up
        to 2,000 times a day. That’s more than a tweet a minute, every minute, for 24 hours. Not even the worst human
        is capable of this.
      </p>
      <p class="text-black-50">In order to acquiring information from general people, it was important to exclude
        invalid data, such as robots and official account of Uber. There were two tools ( <a href="https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/">Botometer</a>
        and <a href="https://foller.me/">foller.me</a>) to identify the user accounts. The judging criteria were the
        number over 3 of 5, which would be treat as robots and the account names that included Uber and be valid by
        official twitter, which would be treat as official accounts.
      </p>
      <p class="text-black-50">There were two steps to clean the data, firstly, using the sort and simple math
        function to find out the users who tweeted over 10 times a day, then detected all of these users accounts.
        Secondly, removing the invalid users data which included the text contents.
      </p>
      <p class="text-black-50">On one hand, there were 81 users tweeted over 10 times a day. By using the tools,
        we categories some types of invalid users, there were account suspended, official account, rot, Ubereats
        recruitment, rot and follower amounts less than 100, which were 10, 6, 10, 3 and 19 separated.

      </p>
      <p class="text-black-50">In the other hand, there were 152 users retweeted over 10 times a day. As the same
        as previous method, there were two types of invalid users, which were account suspended (34) and bot(18).
      </p>
      <p class="text-black-50">Hence, there were the latest top 10 tweeters and retweeters which were general
        people accounts.
        The top tweeter was cuponsddesconto which tweeted 148 during the time, and ossien1 retweeted 193 as top
        retweeter.

        146,457 of tweets and 328,244 of retweets. From the original tweet perspective, there was 2.2% tweets came from
        top 10 tweeter and only 0.4% retweets came from top 10 retweeters. It showed that the information from
        retweeters was more valuable than tweeters, because the information people talking about were less influence by

            Besides, there were two indexes to discuss about the information influence, the amounts of followers and
            tweeters volumes. The graph depicted the amounts of users which divided into different followers range. The
            majority of users have 100 to 9,999 followers. They were 1,813 users which had more than one hundred
            followers and less than one thousand, and 1,417 users which had more than one thousand followers and less
            than ten thousand.

            Finally, there was the graph showed the tweeters volume. It was calculated by tweets times of each user. As
            only one user tweeted over 90 times, most of the people tweeted during one to 10 times during the time.
            There
            were 85% of people tweeted one time, 12.3% of people tweeted two to five times and 1.7% of people tweeted
            six
            to 10 times.
